### Python Advanced Course Intro


### Python OOP Course Intro 
The main skills that I`ve gained from this course are understanding the OOP paradigm, creating a hierarchy of classes and inheritance, SOLID principles, working with iterators and generators, applying the OOP principles, component testing, working with decorators, design patterns.
From this course I was able to learn the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), to work with classes and objects, use object-oriented modeling and build class hierarchies. I also learned the basic principles of OOP such as abstraction (interfaces, abstract classes), encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. I got acquainted with the most frequently used design patterns (creational, structural and behavioral design patterns). As with the SOLID principles of object-oriented software design. I also learned what iterators and generators are and how to use them, how to create and use decorators. We paid attention to component testing (writing unit tests) and the concept of Test Driven Development (TDD).
